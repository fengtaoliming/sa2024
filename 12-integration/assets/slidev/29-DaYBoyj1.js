Technically, the aggregator is more complex than a splitter, because it is required to maintain state (the messages to be aggregated), to decide when the complete group of messages is available, and to timeout if necessary. Furthermore, in case of a timeout, the aggregator needs to know whether to send the partial results, discard them, or send them to a separate channel.
